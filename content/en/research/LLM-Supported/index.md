The solar desalination experimental platform features a TRM-PD linear solar simulation transmitter, a solar pyranometer, and several thermal sensors. The solar simulator consists of a hernia lamp light source, heat dissipation fans, and a corresponding control system, which together can simulate sunlight for conducting low-power solar experiments in the laboratory. This setup is ideal for testing photovoltaic (PV) modules and various solar-centered energy applications, including solar desalination devices. After being activated for 1 minute, the radiation flux stabilizes within a range of ±3%, and the flux can be adjusted between 200 and 1000 W/m².
